title: "Using Playwright to Order a Pizza and Run a Few UI Tests"

I wrote this to demonstrate the Page Object Model in Playwright (and for fun). The Page Object Model is useful as it allows us to make clear distinctions between tests and locators. Furthermore, it allows us to organise pages and modals so that you don't end up duplicating locators. It also keeps the tests free from clutter. I believe Playwright will eclipse legacy UI frameworks like Selenium as it is easier to write, it allows us to run tests in paralell and the simple fact that it has more out-of-the-box features.

Notice how I break the test up into "Steps", this ensures that the point of failure is easy to identify and provides the over all suite with more structure.

```javascript
await test.step("Fill in address details", async () => {
    await dominosPage.addressField.fill("<ADDRESS>");
    await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
    await dominosPage.deliveryButton.click();
    await dominosPage.addressText.click();
    await dominosPage.deliverToMe.click();
});
```
Full disclaimer I am not a fan of hard waits but they do have their place in testing infrastructure, but I beleive they should be minimised by any means necessary.
