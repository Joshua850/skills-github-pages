I always want to start new projects and have a terrible habit of not starting becasue I've made it too complicated or not finishing becasue I've also made it too complicated. My goal is to always have a little project on the go, from infrastrucutre, test automation, front-end or back. This week I didn't know what to do, so I took inspiration from what I did over the weekend and I was lucky enough to go to hook head light house in Wexford which is the oldest functioniong lighthouse in the world.

I decided to draw a lighthouse using only CSS, I could have fallen into my familliar trap of over complicating the design but I think what I made satisfied me and made me laugh a little when I finished. 

Made using React.
