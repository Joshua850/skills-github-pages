title: "Trying to stay sharp"

Working in tech is fun and rewarding but I find I stopped working on personal projects becasue the last place I want to look on my days off is a screen, but if I'm not actively using some of my skills in work I worry they will deteriorate over time. At the moment I work in QA, where I get to write tests, create pipelines and work on some infrastructure, which is great and challanging in a different way but given there are established patterns and frameworks in place it can feel like I'm re-using a lot of code and not writing anything new. Using the same assertions and similar bash scripts.

So here I am trying to stay sharp, I didn't know what to write so I just started writing functions that I did in college where we would have to print the multiples of numbers, print all the odd/even numbers and from there I taught a calculator might be just enough of a challange where but still being doable in a couple hours.

Maybe I'll write a UI for it next week to practise my React skills.
